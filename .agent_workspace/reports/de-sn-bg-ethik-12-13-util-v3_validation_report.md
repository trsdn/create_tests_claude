## Requirements Validation

### ✅ Curriculum Alignment (Sachsen BG Grade 12/13)

**Subject:** Ethik/Philosophie
**Grade Level:** 12/13 (Berufliches Gymnasium Sachsen)
**Curriculum Area:** Lernbereich 1: Philosophische Ethik und Anwendung (32 Stunden)

**Learning Objectives Covered:**
1. ✅ Anwendung utilitaristischer Prinzipien auf komplexe ethische Dilemmata
2. ✅ Differenzierung zwischen Handlungs- und Regelutilitarismus
3. ✅ Kritische Bewertung der Stärken und Schwächen beider Ansätze
4. ✅ Entwicklung einer begründeten philosophischen Position

**Alignment Validation:**
- Thought experiment requires application of both utilitarian frameworks to a modern ethical dilemma
- Questions demand differentiation between act and rule utilitarianism
- Critical evaluation of strengths/weaknesses is explicitly required
- Students must develop and justify their own philosophical position
- Appropriate complexity for Grade 12/13 students who have completed homework on Bergbahn/Transplantation scenarios

---

## Test Design Validation

### ✅ Thought Experiment Uniqueness

**Version 3 Scenario:** "Die Programmierung des autonomen Fahrzeugs"
- Programming emergency algorithms for self-driving vehicles
- Dilemma: Algorithmus A (minimize total deaths) vs. Algorithmus B (protect rule-compliant persons and passengers)
- Modern, technology-focused scenario relevant to students' lived experience

**Comparison with Existing Versions:**
- ❌ NOT the 120-min version: "Whistleblower im Pharmakonzern" (pharmaceutical data manipulation)
- ❌ NOT homework: "Bergbahn" scenario (cable car emergency)
- ❌ NOT homework: "Transplantation" scenario (organ transplant ethics)
- ✅ UNIQUE: Autonomous vehicle programming dilemma

**Why This Scenario Works:**
- Clear numerical consequences (1 death vs. 5 deaths)
- Involves rule-compliance dimension (regelwidrig vs. regelkonform behavior)
- Has long-term implications (millions of vehicles, societal trust)
- Forces choice between immediate optimization (act utilitarianism) and rule-based optimization (rule utilitarianism)
- Contemporary relevance increases student engagement

- ✅ No excessive copying or reading required
- ✅ Questions build progressively from understanding → application → analysis → evaluation

**Comparison with 120-min version:**
- 120-min version: 5 tasks, 60 points, 90 minutes estimated time
- Version 3: 4 tasks, 45 points, 45 minutes estimated time
- ✅ Appropriate reduction in scope and complexity

---

### ✅ Philosophical Content Validation

**Handlungsutilitarismus (Act Utilitarianism):**

**Expected Student Understanding:**
- ✅ Consequentialism: Actions judged solely by consequences
- ✅ Utility maximization: Greatest good for greatest number
- ✅ Case-by-case evaluation: Each action judged individually
- ✅ Quantitative calculation: Count and compare outcomes

**Application to Scenario:**
- ✅ Correct recommendation: Algorithmus A (minimize deaths: 1 < 5)
- ✅ Reasoning: Immediate consequence calculation favors saving 4 additional lives
- ✅ Philosophical accuracy: Rule-compliance is irrelevant to act utilitarian calculation
- ✅ Challenge: Ignores long-term societal implications

**Regelutilitarismus (Rule Utilitarianism):**

**Expected Student Understanding:**
- ✅ Rule focus: Evaluate rules, not individual actions
- ✅ Long-term optimization: Rules that maximize utility when generally followed
- ✅ Universalizability: What if everyone followed this rule?
- ✅ Indirect consequences: Trust, incentives, social coordination

**Application to Scenario:**
- ✅ Correct recommendation: Algorithmus B (protect rule-compliant persons)
- ✅ Reasoning: Rules protecting rule-compliance have superior long-term utility
- ✅ Key rules identified:
  - Protect persons who behave in rule-compliant manner
  - Technical systems should be trustworthy and predictable
  - Manufacturers have duty of care to customers
  - Do not actively harm uninvolved, rule-compliant persons
- ✅ Philosophical accuracy: Short-term suboptimality justified by long-term benefits

**Comparative Analysis:**

**Expected Student Insights:**
- ✅ Divergent recommendations (A vs. B) demonstrate fundamental difference
- ✅ Time horizon: Immediate vs. long-term consequences
- ✅ Social context: Act utilitarianism isolates action; rule utilitarianism considers systemic effects
- ✅ Trade-off: Single-case optimality vs. rule-based stability

**Critical Evaluation:**

**Handlungsutilitarismus Strengths:**
- Direct utility maximization (4 lives saved)
- Flexibility to respond to specific circumstances
- Clear, transparent calculation
- Efficiency (no "wasted" lives due to abstract rules)

**Handlungsutilitarismus Weaknesses:**
- Ignores long-term consequences (trust, incentives, acceptance)
- Instrumentalization of rule-compliant person
- Unpredictability creates insecurity
- Violates justice intuitions (rewards rule-breaking)

**Regelutilitarismus Strengths:**
- Considers long-term and indirect consequences
- Promotes predictability and social coordination
- Protects fundamental principles (rule-compliance, customer protection)
- Pragmatic (technology requires trust to function)

**Regelutilitarismus Weaknesses:**
- Suboptimal in individual case (5 deaths vs. 1)
- Rule rigidity (cannot flexibly respond to special circumstances)
- Difficult rule-finding (which rules are optimal long-term?)
- Justification problem (hard to explain to families of victims)

## Recommendations for Use

### Before the Test

**Teacher Preparation:**
1. Review answer key thoroughly, especially model answers and common errors
2. Ensure students have completed homework (Bergbahn/Transplantation scenarios)
3. Brief review of key terms: Handlungsutilitarismus, Regelutilitarismus, Konsequentialismus
4. Clarify that students may choose either philosophical position in Task 4 (both are valid)

**Student Preparation:**
1. Students should have completed homework assignment (prerequisite knowledge)
2. Students should be familiar with basic utilitarian terminology
3. Students should understand structure: principle → application → comparison → evaluation

### During the Test

**Time Management:**
- Recommend students allocate approximately 1 minute per point
- Task 1 & 2: ~12 minutes each
- Task 3: ~16 minutes
- Task 4: ~5 minutes
- Students who struggle with time can reduce elaboration in Task 3b or Task 4

**Differentiation:**
- Fast students may finish in 40 minutes
- Average students should complete in 45 minutes
- Below-average students may need up to 50-55 minutes (acceptable variance)

### After the Test

**Grading Priorities:**
1. Quality of philosophical reasoning > correctness of position
2. Systematic application > memorized definitions
3. Independent thinking > reproducing teacher's views
4. Coherent argumentation > length of answer

**Common Student Challenges:**
- Confusing Handlungsutilitarismus with Regelutilitarismus (check carefully!)
- Staying too abstract and not applying to the scenario
- Incomplete argumentation (only considering one aspect)
- Missing the long-term dimension in regelutilitaristic analysis

## Appendix: Thought Experiment Summary

**Scenario:** "Die Programmierung des autonomen Fahrzeugs"

**Core Dilemma:**
An engineer must decide how to program emergency algorithms for self-driving cars. In an unavoidable accident situation:
- 5 pedestrians cross the street illegally (regelwidrig)
- The vehicle can either: (A) Continue straight → 5 die, passenger safe, or (B) Swerve to sidewalk → 1 rule-compliant pedestrian dies, 5 saved

**Algorithmus A (Act Utilitarian Choice):**
- Minimize total deaths (1 < 5)
- Immediate consequence calculation

**Algorithmus B (Rule Utilitarian Choice):**
- Protect rule-compliant persons and passengers
- Long-term trust, incentives, acceptance

**Philosophical Tension:**
- Handlungsutilitarismus: Save 4 additional lives now
- Regelutilitarismus: Follow rules that maximize long-term utility (even if suboptimal in this case)

**Why This Works:**
- Clear numerical comparison (1 vs. 5)
- Rule-compliance dimension built in
- Long-term vs. short-term consequences naturally embedded
- Modern, relevant to students' experience
- Forces genuine philosophical choice between two utilitarian frameworks
